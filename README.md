# Twiter API | FastAPI âš¡

This project was made for the FastAPI Course at Platzi.

It's an API for twitter, but in this twitter you can **edit a tweet**.

## Run the app

You just need to download the code, start a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries. All with the following commands:

```
- virtualenv venv
- source venv/bin/activate
- pip install "fastapi[all]"
- pip install "pydantic[email]"
# Run the server
- uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Data Storage

Right now the project uses two JSON files to store the data of thw tweets and the users.

- tweets.json
- users.json

## Models

The app works with two models:

- tweets model
- users model

## Still working...
There are things that I still need to work on. For example I want to add Database storage, and I need to complete the code for all the path operations.

This project will be getting updated.
